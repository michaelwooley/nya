# 👉 🕶️ 👈 NYA ("No, _you're_ awesome")

A graph of [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) resources.

TODO #11 Add use cases + ideas + non-goals to top-level README.

<!-- _NON-GOAL:_ Replace the awesome human curation of awesome repos with some dumb, locally-optimal recommendation engine. BOR-ING (and useless). -->

<!-- Basically, awesome repos have a topic (e.g. "python", "robotics") and they link to a bunche of awesome, human-curated resources on that topic (code, blogs, videos). If these repos were characters in a play, they'd be like, "Bro, you're awesome 👉. And I'm gonna let the world know." -->
