# Boilerplate updates (cookiecutter, cruft)

- This repo is initialized from [`fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry`](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry)
- Make several modifications here.
- Separate branch [`boilerplate`](https://github.com/michaelwooley/nya/tree/boilerplate) contains changes that only affect boilerplate.
- Label MRs relevant to this with _`boilerplate`_ label.
- ❗ Need to move `.github` up in this project. But keep as-is in the boilerplate.

# Boilerplate enhancements

Some ideas.

## Parameterization

- [ ] Select python version to support
